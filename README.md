# 🌐 Gemini Web Browser

An experimental web browser powered by Google's Gemini AI, designed to make web browsing more intuitive and accessible through natural language interactions.

## 🌟 Vision

Imagine a web browser that understands your intentions, not just your clicks. The Gemini Web Browser is an open-source experiment that aims to bridge the gap between human thought and web navigation. Instead of learning complex UI patterns or remembering specific buttons to click, you simply tell the browser what you want to do - in your own words.

## ✨ Features

- 🗣️ **Natural Language Navigation**: Browse the web using simple commands like "go to eBay and search for guitars"
- 🤖 **AI-Powered Actions**: Gemini AI understands context and performs complex sequences of actions
- 🖼️ **Visual Understanding**: The AI can see and interact with web page elements
- 🎯 **Smart Element Selection**: Automatically finds and interacts with the right buttons, forms, and links
- 📱 **Modern UI**: Built with PySide6 for a clean, native look and feel
